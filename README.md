**Kfone** is a hypothetical telecommunications enterprise use case that has a set of web-based sample applications, APIs, and system integrations.  It uses [**Asgardeo as a CIAM provider**](https://wso2.com/asgardeo/) along with [**Choreo, a cloud native app development platform**](https://wso2.com/choreo/) to showcase how Asgardeo and Choreo cater for B2C and B2B related CIAM use cases, that well integrates with business services and APIs for optimized business operations and to provide secure, frictionless, personalized experiences for consumers.

This use case demonstration includes,
 - a website where prospects of Kfone visit, surf, download materials, view content, contact Kfone personnels, buy and register to access digital services.

- a set of business APIs the above applications consume. With respect to the scope of this hypothetical use case, only API contracts, and service integrations are defined and managed, whereas business logic implementations just include static implementations just to showcase how various APIs can be integrated, orchestrated, exposed and managed for secure access from an app frontend.
